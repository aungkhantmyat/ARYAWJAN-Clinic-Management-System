# ARYAWJAN-Clinic-Management-System üè• üíª
## Brief
  Many clinics in Myanmar currently rely on a manual system for various tasks such as scheduling patient appointments at the reception, maintaining patient records, and handling clinic information using numerous hard-copy files. This file-based system involves considerable effort and manpower for tasks like billing and inventory management. Unfortunately, this approach is susceptible to issues such as data loss, damage to files, and misplacement of information. Our system aims to alleviate these challenges associated with manual processes. 
  By implementing our system, clinics can streamline operations, allowing doctors and clinic staff to efficiently manage patient records without the need for manual activities.

## System Features
1. **Appointment Booking**: Patients have the convenience of easily scheduling appointments through the clinic website.
2. **Patient**: Within the patient account, users can access online appointment scheduling, maintain medical record books, and attach medical files.
3. **Doctor**: Doctors can seamlessly conduct treatment processes online.
4. **Pharmacist**: Pharmacists can handle the selling process and manage medicine inventory through their dedicated accounts.
5. **Receptionist**: Receptionists can efficiently handle appointment scheduling and billing processes within their accounts.
6. **Admin**: The admin account enables comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) processes for all staff, ambulances, and other clinic inventories.
